                    <h1 class="headline">Mechanical&nbsp;execution, Creative&nbsp;thinking</h1>

                    <p>
                        Early in life, Ryan Gasparini had a dream to design automobiles. As a child he made various drawings of cars and trucks on napkins, placemats, and notebooks. In high school, he elected to take classes in manual and computer-aided drafting. His passion and skill for drawing and drafting earned him many <a href="http://www.mites.cc/">regional awards</a> in Mechanical Drawing.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After graduation, he enrolled in university to pursue a degree in mechanical engineering. Unfortunately, not having any experience in the matter, he failed the shop and material classes. Surprisingly, though, when it came to computer programming, he was a natural. It was ultimately a C programming class that influenced him to change his career path.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Aside from drafting, Ryan spent many afternoons in the high school computer lab. He spent the majority of that time learning how to build a snowboarding page on Geocities. That time spent tinkering with tags and selectors gave him the tools to understand semantic markup and cascading style.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At the time, the Internet was just a hobby for him. Once he discovered JavaScript and, eventually, ActionScript, he decided to use his love of the Web with his knowledge of C to make the Internet a better place.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Even today, Ryan continues to pursue design and programming. He has earned the opportunity, both as employee and consultant, to build sites for a wide range of organizations. In an industry where any random guy named Ryan can learn these skills, he has separated himself from the rest by merging what he has learned with his gifts of good taste, empathy, and the pursuit of simplicity.

                    <h1 class="headline">A dynamic guy for the static&nbsp;quo</h1>

                    <p>
                        Ryan got his start as an HTML/CSS hobbyist but quickly moved on to projects of greater scale and challenge. Since 2001, the launch of this very site, he's matured from slicing Photoshop documents to a role in senior-level engineering.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Using ActionScript, he's built software demos for a CAD company and an interactive gallery for Phoenix Art Museum. With PHP, he built his first multi-site platform and content management system to serve about 100 marketing sites for Best Western.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After learning Ruby on Rails, Ryan was able to devote more time to the front-end. He built a video library prototype using Backbone, refactored a reporting dashboard in Ember, and collaborated on an Angular app that organized SEC filings for Fortune 500 companies.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Today, he can be found balancing his time between writing ReactJS and learning Objective C. Ryan is <a href="#contact">currently available</a> for contract work or full-time employment. The following are an overview of his talents and experience.
