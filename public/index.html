                Mechanical&nbsp;execution, creative&nbsp;thinking
              </h1>

              <p>
                Early in life, Ryan Gasparini had a dream to design automobiles.
                As a child he made various drawings of cars and trucks on
                napkins, placemats, and notebooks. In high school, he elected to
                take classes in manual and computer-aided drafting. His passion
                and skill for drawing and drafting earned him many
                <a href="http://www.mites.cc/">regional awards</a> in Mechanical
                Drawing.
              </p>

              <p>
                After graduation, he enrolled in university to pursue a degree
                in mechanical engineering. Unfortunately, not having any
                experience in the matter, he failed the shop and material
                classes. Surprisingly, though, when it came to computer
                programming, he was a natural. It was ultimately a C programming
                class that influenced him to change his career path.
              </p>

              <p>
                Aside from drafting, Ryan spent many afternoons in the high
                school computer lab. He spent the majority of that time learning
                how to build a snowboarding page on Geocities. That time spent
                tinkering with tags and selectors gave him the tools to
                understand semantic markup and cascading style.
              </p>

              <p>
                At the time, the Internet was just a hobby for him. Once he
                discovered JavaScript and, eventually, ActionScript, he decided
                to use his love of the Web with his knowledge of C to make the
                Internet a better place.
              </p>

              <p>
                Even today, Ryan continues to pursue design and programming. He
                has earned the opportunity, both as employee and consultant, to
                build sites for a wide range of organizations. In an industry
                where any random guy named Ryan can learn these skills, he has
                separated himself from the rest by merging what he has learned
                with his gifts of good taste, empathy, and the pursuit of
                simplicity.

              <h1 class="headline">A dynamic guy for the static&nbsp;quo</h1>

              <p>
                Ryan got his start as an HTML/CSS hobbyist but quickly moved on
                to projects of greater scale and challenge. Since 2001, the
                launch of this very site, he's matured from slicing Photoshop
                documents to a role in senior-level engineering.
              </p>

              <p>
                Using ActionScript, he's built software demos for a CAD company
                and an interactive gallery for Phoenix Art Museum. With PHP, he
                built his first multi-site platform and content management
                system to serve about 100 marketing sites for Best Western.
              </p>

              <p>
                After learning Ruby on Rails, Ryan was able to devote more time
                to the front-end. He built a video library prototype using
                Backbone, refactored a reporting dashboard in Ember, and
                collaborated on an Angular app that organized SEC filings for
                Fortune 500 companies.
              </p>

              <p>
                Today, he can be found balancing his time between writing
                JavaScript and trying to get to platinum level in competive
                Overwatch. Ryan is
                <a href="#contact">currently available</a> for contract work or
                full-time employment. The following are an overview of his
                talents and experience.
